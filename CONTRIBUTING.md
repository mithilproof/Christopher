We are working on an official message board with a detailed FAQ and where the community chimes in with helpful advice if you have questions.

## What should I know before I get started?

### Christopher
We are tring to solve illiteracy and this is not an easy job. There is no certain syllabus to know about what a **_contributor_** should know. But we tried very hard to refine the role of developers. 

### Design Decisions
When we make a significant decision in how we maintain the project and what we can or can not support, we will document it in the [christopher/design-decision repo](). If you have a question around how we do things, check to see if it is documented there. If it is _not_ documented there, please open a new topic on [Discuss, the official stemAI message board]() and ask your questions.

## How can I contribute?

### Reporting Bugs 👾
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Christopher. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behaviour :construction:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug report, please check [this list]() as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you're creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible.](). Fill out the [required template](Christopher/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it ask for helps us resolve issues faster.
> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report**
	
- Check the debugging guide. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem in the lastest version of Christopher.
- Check the FAQs on the forum for a list of common questions and problems.
- Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.
- Perform a cursory search to see the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the exisiting issue instead of opening a new one.

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?**

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issue. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maitainers reproduce the problem:
	- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
	- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started the App. When listing steps,**don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.**
