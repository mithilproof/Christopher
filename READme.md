##Christopher 

**Christopher** is a research project exploring the role of machine intelligence in solving the problem of **_illiteracy_**. Primarily this involves developing new machine intelligent tools and techniques to make children learn with 100% *human-free* and *non-verbal* methodologies. But it's also an exploration in building smarter interfaces that allow teachers and educators to extend their processes of teaching and delivering new techniques using these models. We use [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Megenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) as our supporting libraries and release our models and tools in open source on this GitHub repository. If you would like to learn more about Christopher, check out our [blog](https://www.stemai.github.io), where we post technical details. You can also join our discussion group.
