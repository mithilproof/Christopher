## Christopher

**Christopher** is a research project exploring the role of Artificial Intelligence in solving the global problem of **_illiteracy_**. Primarily this involves developing new machine intelligent tools and techniques to make children learn without need to be taught how. It is also an exploration in building smarter interfaces through state-of-the-art symbolic design languages that allow children with no reading and writing experience to learn. Also with this model we believe, teachers and educators would extend their processes of teaching and delivering new techniques.

The repo is mostly under construction and we do not release our code uniformly. If you wish get the access of private repo, please contact the maintainer at hi@stemai.org.

We also keep posting our research in AI and Cognitive Sciences. Feel free to check in at medium.com/stemai. Thank you, you guys means alot. :tada:
