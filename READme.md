## Christopher 

**Christopher** is a research project exploring the role of Artificial Intelligence to empower every child on the planet to learn more. Primarily this involves developing new machine intelligent tools and techniques to make children learn with 100% *human-free* and *non-verbal* methodologies. But it's also an exploration in building smarter interfaces that allow teachers and educators to extend their processes of teaching and delivering new techniques using these models. We use [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Megenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) as our supporting libraries and release our models and tools in open source on this GitHub repository. If you would like to learn more about Christopher, check out our [blog](https://medium.com/stemai), where we post technical details and fun conversations with our tech team. You can also join our discussion group.

We also keep posting our research in AI and Cognitive Sciences. Feel free to check in at medium.com/stemai. Thank you, you guys means alot. :tada:
